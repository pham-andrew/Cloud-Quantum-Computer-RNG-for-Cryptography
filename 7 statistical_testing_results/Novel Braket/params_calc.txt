    [1] Block Frequency Test - block length(M):         101
n ≥ MN; 10k is bigger than 1000
M ≥ 20
M > .01n; m needs to be bigger than 100
N=10 by default but needs to be N < 100

    [2] NonOverlapping Template Test - block length(m): 
M is block length, m is slide window

    [3] Overlapping Template Test - block length(m):    
not enough bits to do this test

    [4] Approximate Entropy Test - block length(m):     7
m < floor(log2 n) -5
m < 8

    [5] Serial Test - block length(m):                  10
m < floor(log2 n) -2
m < 11

    [6] Linear Complexity Test - block length(M):       
not enough bits lol, 500 is min
