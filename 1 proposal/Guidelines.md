# Software Engineering Thesis Proposal Guidelines

Proposal Guidelines: The final proposal should be minimum 3500 words



## 1.  Project Title

Create a title that is as informative as possible. It should be concise and accurate and contain a short description of the proposed study that explains what is unique in your project and inform the reader as to what is specific to the proposed research.



## 2.  Research Problem and Aims

You should introduce your research problem as early as you can in the proposal. It should refer to the current state of the art and why the problem exists. It should be brief and include your research aims i.e. what do you want to investigate, prove or analyze etc?  For the thesis, expect to delineate three aims (at least two and no more than five), which can be briefly described with a sentence or two for each aim.  The aims should be given in a logical order, relate directly to the research problem, be attainable within the time frame of your thesis research and be within your level of expertise.  Any hypothesis you wish to test should also be clearly stated in this section (although this may not be relevant for certain projects).  To meet thesis requirements, your research should answer an unsolved question(s), or in a novel area of the field that builds upon previous work that you can reference.



## 3.  Definition of Terms

You should list the terms used in your proposal in alphabetical order and define them according to how they are being used within the context of your proposal.  Include any acronyms and what they stand for.



## 4. Background and Significance (Literature Review)

Please provide background information for the topic and describe prior research and how your proposed research/product/method fits in this framework.  In this section, you should include a review of the literature and add context for the research you are proposing i.e. what is known and unknown in the field.  You should explain why your proposed research is a novel contribution in relation to other published work in the field.  Remember that the purpose of your research is to advance knowledge and new ideas in the field.  In a literature review, you should survey the contributions of other researchers in the field, identify and discuss seminal papers and explain where the latest advances are being made. The literature review should also develop a logical rationale for your proposal and how your proposed research/approaches will contribute to the field and explain why your research is novel i.e. it should not be a repetition of previous research in the field.  

To begin the review, you will need to access literature databases and search for articles to read.  You can begin by locating published reviews and survey articles and use these to identify some of the seminal papers.  After you have read these papers, you should also locate and read supporting articles as well as the latest contributions to the field.  At this stage you are ready to begin writing your review.

The literature review should be well referenced, with references provided at the proper locations in the text. The references should be scholarly resources and using APA or IEEE reference format. These references are part of your reading and will become part of the bibliography / reference list you are building.

Later on you will be using this section as the foundation for the Introduction of your thesis (Chapter 1) and it should be as thorough as possible.  



## 5.  Scope of the Research

This section defines the scope of your research. It should discuss which areas will be included and which will be excluded from your proposed research, identify which kind of project or study is being undertaken and discuss any limitations.



## 6.  Research Design and Methods

You will outline your methods and the specific techniques you propose to try for the research question you have identified.  This section should include the metrics that you will be using and how you will measure and evaluate the outputs of your research.  It should include any detailed protocols you will be using, as well as the data sources and computing resources that will be required, including data processing, algorithms, software and tools, and how these methods are appropriate for the proposed research. When describing the methods, you should also provide references within the body of the text, as well as technical details.  The description should be detailed enough for someone with the appropriate knowledge and skills to assess the feasibility of your proposal.



## 7.  Anticipated Results and Preliminary Results (if any)

State in precise terms what the expected outcomes of your research will be and refer to any preliminary results that have  been obtained, either by you or as presented by others in the  literature.  Precisely stating the anticipated results demonstrates that you have properly understood the scope of the research problem and it will help you assess your progress towards your goals during the course of your research.

 

## 8.  Work Plan and Tentative Schedule

Identify the successive stages and milestones for completing your project, along with a list of tentative target dates. The dates are not strict deadlines but should convey a sense of how the project will  develop within the time frame that is available. The various stages  should be completed in a logical sequence according to your research  plan, and the amount of time required for each stage of the project will vary. Please include a timetable.



## 9.  References

This section lists all of your in-text citations using APA style or IEEE style.
